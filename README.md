# NanaFS

NanaFS is a fs-style workflow engine. 
It is also a warehouse for unified management of your structured and unstructured data.

In personal work, study and life, a large amount of data and materials are stored in different information islands. 
Such as Office files, Email, Todo List. I've spent a lot of time writing glue workflows make they can be managed together. 
Someday, I got bored: Fuck it, why not make a FS with a built-in workflow, then NanaFS is here.
